<!-- This is a simple website created with HTML and CSS. It was done as a challenge to create a website in 4 hours, including an hour for design. 
	The finished product looks fairly close to the design mockup, which was created with Sketch 3. 
	I used a custom grid framework, with 12 columns.
	The layout follows a commonly used portfolio layout. 
	- Header: A logo and a few links.
	- Introduction: A 'hello' message, along with a photo.
	- Portfolio: A few links to portfolio pieces.

	Post-mortem: The website is simple, but still has some issues.
	1. Neither the CSS or HTML have been validated.
	2. The links at the top of the page don't go anywhere or do anything.
	3. On smaller screens, the layout smashes together. aka it is non-responsive. 
	4. The CSS is all contained in one file. It might be a better idea to break it out into two files. This will make the layout less error prone in the future. 
	5. Many CSS styles are repeated. I may have been able to make it more modular, making it less error prone, given extra time.
	6. The CSS involves a layout hack for vertical centering that may be outdated. See comment inside stylesheet.
	7. The design is ineffective insofar as being a major highlight piece for my portfolio, although to be fair, that wasn't the point of the exercise. 
	8. Probably other stuff.
